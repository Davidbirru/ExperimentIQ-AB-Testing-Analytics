## 📈 Key Metrics Calculated

### Conversion Rate

Conversion Rate = Converted Users / Total Users

### Relative Lift

Relative Lift = (Variant B − Variant A) / Variant A × 100

### Statistical Significance

* Z-Test
* P-Value Analysis
* Confidence Intervals

### Power Analysis

Determines whether the experiment had sufficient sample size to detect meaningful effects.
